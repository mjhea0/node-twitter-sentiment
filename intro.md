So, I'm Michael Herman. I've been a back-end developer in Ruby and Python for about three years. I wrote a Python course for learning web development called Real Python (who is the principal sponsor) and I also do Python, Ruby, and Javascript mentoring/tutoring through pairing.io. That site is actually pretty bare right now, but I am speaking at the Boulder JS meetup tomorrow and will demonstrate how to jazz it up a bit. Come on by. Anyway ..

So that's who I am. I'd love to know who you are. Unfortunately we do not have time for all of you to introduce yourselves. For now just raise your hand if you have worked with Node/Express before. Please keep me accountable for what I say. For those who didn't raise their hand, did you go through my intro tutorial. For those who still haven't raised your hands ... shame on you. Kidding. Get what you can out of this. Connect. Then if you want, go home and try the intro tutorial.

...

Alright, so today we will be going over a more advanced Node and Express tutorial. Let's just take a look at the end product here. Basically you can enter two things you wish to compare. When you submit, the twitter api is called, the last 20 tweets from today are pulled, and then sentiment is performed. So perhaps you and your significant other are bickering over what movie to see. Just pop the two titles in the app and let the twitter universe decide for you. Fight resolved. 

I've created a blog post to go along with this tutorial, which I will send out to all members after the meetup. 

If you want, you can code right along with me. I type super slow when people are watching, but feel free to stop me if I'm going too fast. Or if you'd rather observe that's fine too. Now, I will be copying and pasting every now and then to save time. If you do follow along, you can grab the code from the Github repo.

If you have questions, please either shout it out over me. Or if you'd rather save your question until the end, we will also have a more formal Q&A session.

Okay, without further ado, let's begin ..

Any questions?

Thanks so much. I hope this was helpful. My email is michael@mherman.org. Feel free to contact me about anything. Again, I am availble for mentoring/tutoring. I specialize in Python, Ruby, and JavaScript. Thank you!
